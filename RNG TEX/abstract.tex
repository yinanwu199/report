\section*{Abstract}

This report is about the basic principles and methods for the random number generators used in simulation. The emphasis is on the methods of uniform random generators, which can be later transformed to other sequence of numbers following different distribution. we consider the linear recurrence as a easy mathematical structure for building a uniform random number sequence. This methodology is convenient to be understood and applied, and this is also one of the most common generators used in simulation. Secondly, we will discuss 
the non-uniform random generators. The algorithms include the inverse method, Box-Muller Method. Finally, we will discuss the statistical testing to verify whether our generator is appropriate or not.\\

Keywords: random number generator, linear congruential generator, uniform random generator, the inverse method, box-muller method, statistical test. \\
